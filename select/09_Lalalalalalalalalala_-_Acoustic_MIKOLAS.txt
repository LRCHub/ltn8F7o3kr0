Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah)

I be out up in the club (up in the club)
Don't say you're sorry
I am puttin' my hands up
Don't need nobody
We are done bella ciao
I want out had enough
Keep your la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

Coming up on my bolo
(My bolo)
She looking fire on the gram only riding solo
(Only riding solo)
Iced out on the cam

She swipe that
Left right left
Want you gone out of my bed
You're low key mad your bad
If you think I'm coming back, oh

I be out up in the club (up in the club)
Don't say you're sorry
I am puttin' my hands up
Don't need nobody
We are done bella ciao
I want out had enough
Keep your la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

Back in Cali, you cray cray about me
Up to the floor Clyde, you were my Bonnie
Hands on my body, Enzo Ferrari
We rolling on the floor in the hotel lobby

Went from
Left right left
Want you gone out of my bed
You're low key mad your bad
If you think I'm coming back oh

I be out up in the club (up in the club)
Don't say you're sorry
I am puttin' my hands up
Don't need nobody
We are done bella ciao
I want out had enough
Keep your la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

You run your mouth all over town
Like I care for your drama
Always out there hating on me
Messing up your karma
You ain't got no place to go
Please stop calling me up
We are done, bella ciao
I want out had enough

I be out up in the club
Don't say you're sorry
I am puttin' my hands up (say you're sorry)
Don't need nobody
We are done bella ciao
I want out had enough
Keep your la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
