```
I don’t give a single fuck
(nah nah nah)
Don’t say you’re sorry
I be out up in the club (yeah)
Don’t need nobody
We are done, bella ciao
I want out, had enough
Fuck your
la-lalala lalala lalala
Coming up on my bolo (aha)
She looking fire on the gram
only riding solo (aha)
Iced out on the cam
she swipe that
Left right left
Get the fuck out off my bed
You’re low key mad
Your bad, if you think
I’m coming back oh
I don’t give a single fuck
(nah nah nah)
Don’t say you’re sorry
I be out up in the club
(up in the club)
Don’t need nobody
We are done, bella ciao
I want out, had enough
Fuck your
la-lalala lalala lalala
Fuck your la-lalala
Baby we are done (yeah)
La-lalala
So long bella ciao
F*ck your la-lalala
I think I had enough now
fuck your
La-lalala lalala lalala
Back in Cali,
you cray cray about me
Hook to the floor
Clyde you were my Bonnie
Hands on my body, Enzo Ferrari
We rolling on the floor
in the hotel lobby went from
Left right left
Get the fuck out off my bed
You’re low key mad
Your bad, if you think
I’m coming back oh
I don’t give a single fuck
(nah nah nah)
Don’t say you’re sorry
I be out up in the club
(up in the club)
Don’t need nobody
We are done, bella ciao
I want out, had enough
Fuck your
la-lalala lalala lalala
F*ck your la-lalala
Baby we are done (yeah)
La-lalala
So long bella ciao
Fuck your la-lalala
I think I had enough now
fuck your
La-lalala lalala lalala
(Fuck your love)
You run your mouth all over town
Like I care for your drama
Always out there hating on me
Fucking up your karma
You ain't got no place to go
Please stop calling me up
We are done, bella ciao
I want out, had enough
Fuck your la-lalala
Baby we are done (Baby we done)
La-lalala
So long bella ciao
(So long bella ciao)
Fuck your la-lalala
I think I had enough now
fuck your
La-lalala lalala lalala
Fuck your la-lalala
Baby we are done
(oh nah nah nah)
La-lalala
So long bella ciao
Fuck your la-lalala
I think I had enough now
fuck your
La-lalala lalala lalala
